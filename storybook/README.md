# Storybook Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) app that can be deployed with ZEIT Now and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Storybook project with ZEIT Now.

[![Deploy with ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/button)](https://zeit.co/new/project?template=https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/storybook)

*Live Example: https://storybook.now-examples.now.sh*

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Storybook deployed with ZEIT Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init storybook
```

> The only change made is to amend the output directory to `"public"` in the build script.

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Storybook project with a single command from your terminal using [Now CLI](/download):

```shell
$ now
```
